# PacketFilter

> Note: The PF generator is currently in alpha testing. The output should be compatible with OpenBSD v4.7 PF and later.

```
target:: packetfilter filter-name {inet|inet6|mixed} {in|out} {nostate}
```

* _filter-name_: a short, descriptive policy identifier
* _inet_: specifies that the resulting filter should only render IPv4 addresses.
* _inet6_: specifies that the resulting filter should only render IPv6 addresses.
* _mixed_: specifies that the resulting filter should only render IPv4 and IPv6 addresses (default).
* _in_: match ingoing packets (default: both directions).
* _out_: match outgoing packets (default: both directions).
* _nostate_: do not keep state on connections (default: keep state).

## Term Format

* _action::_ The action to take when matched. See Actions section for valid options.
* _comment::_ A text comment enclosed in double-quotes.  The comment can extend over multiple lines if desired, until a closing quote is encountered.
* _destination-address::_ One or more destination address tokens
* _destination-exclude::_ Exclude one or more address tokens from the specified destination-address
* _destination-interface::_ Specify the destination interface. Implicitly changes the term direction to *out* for this term. Mutually exclusive with _source-interface::_.
* _source-interface::_ Specify the source interface. Implicitly changes the term direction to *in* for this term. Mutually exclusive with _destination-interface::_.
* _destination-port::_ One or more service definition tokens
* _expiration::_ stop rendering this term after specified date. [YYYY](YYYY.md)-[MM](MM.md)-[DD](DD.md)
* _icmp-type::_ Specify icmp-type code to match, see section [ICMP TYPES](PolicyFormat#ICMP_TYPES.md) for list of valid arguments
* _logging::_ Specify that this packet should be logged via syslog.
* _name::_ Name of the term.
* _option::_ See platforms supported Options section.
* _platform::_ one or more target platforms for which this term should ONLY be rendered.
* _platform-exclude:: one or more target platforms for which this term should NEVER be rendered.
* _protocol::_ the network protocols this term will match, such as tcp, udp, icmp, or a numeric value.
* _source-address::_ one or more source address tokens.
* _source-exclude::_ exclude one or more address tokens from the specified source-address.
* _source-port::_ one or more service definition tokens.
* _verbatim::_ this specifies that the text enclosed within quotes should be rendered into the output without interpretation or modification.  This is sometimes used as a temporary workaround while new required features are being added.
