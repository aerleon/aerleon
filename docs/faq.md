# Frequently Asked Questions

## What Does Aerleon Mean?
Aerleon is a fork of the Capirca project, which was originally intended to be named after the planet Caprica from Battlestar Galactica. Unfortunately, there was a typo error in the initial release of the project to the public. In recognition of the project's origins, we have chosen a different planet from Battlestar Galactica and made a slight alteration to its spelling, as a respectful nod to the source of this fork.

## Pronunciation?
The origins of the name Capirca may not be familiar to everyone, and as a result, we have heard various pronunciations. These words are made up, so there is no one correct way to pronounce them. The maintainers of the project, however, pronounce Capirca as "Cap-irr-ca" and Aerleon as "Air-leon".
