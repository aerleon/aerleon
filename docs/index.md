# Aerleon Overview

Aerleon is a lightweight library which generates firewall configurations from a normalized data model. Users of the library provide their intention in the form of data (which can be expressed in several ways) and the library generates configuration.

## Description

The data primarily consists of:
* Policy Files that represent the actual firewall rules.
* Address Files that represent the addresses, in the form of named objects.
* Service Files that represent the services, in the form of named objects.
