# Installation

## Prerequisites
* [Python 3.7+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
    * If your system Python does not meet that requirement you can leverage [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) to maintain one or more Python versions that can be set on a per directory basis.
* [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/getting-started/)

**_NOTE:_** It is recommended to use a virtual environment such as the Python built-in [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) module or the [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) package. 

Option 1: Install from PyPI.

```bash
pip install aerleon
```

Option 2: Install from a GitHub branch, such as main as shown below.

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/aerleon/aerleon.git@main
```

At this point you should be able to verify `aclgen` was installed. The path may be different for you depending on your environment.

```bash
which aclgen
/home/rob/.cache/pypoetry/virtualenvs/aerleon-1XT7bGG2-py3.10/bin/aclgen
```
If you do not see a path it is possible the installation did not work successfully. Please reach out to us by filing an [issue](https://github.com/aerleon/aerleon/issues).


## Verifying Installation

At each release we sign build artifacts with [Sigstore](https://www.sigstore.dev/) to allow for validation [SLSA](https://slsa.dev/) file to help provide integrity from supply chain attacks. The instructions provided here will work on most linux distributions. Windows may require a different but comparable tool listed in the prerequisites and modifications to the instructions. Some of the tools may already be installed, if not they are likely available via your package management system.

## Prerequisites
- [openssl](https://github.com/openssl/openssl)
- [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/manual/)
- [curl](https://curl.se/)

## Instructions
1. Download the `whl`, `whl.crt`, `whl.sig`, and `jsonl` files from the latest release
```bash
REPO="aerleon/aerleon"
VER=$(curl --silent -qI https://github.com/$REPO/releases/latest |
      awk -F '/' '/^location/ {print  substr($NF, 1, length($NF)-1)}');
wget https://github.com/$REPO/releases/download/$VER/provenance-sigstore-$VER.intoto.jsonl
wget https://github.com/$REPO/releases/download/$VER/aerleon-$VER-py3-none-any.whl
```


2. Inspect the certificate
```bash
cat provenance-sigstore-1.0.1.intoto.jsonl | jq -r '.signatures[0].cert' | openssl x509 -text -noout
```
We use OpenID to sign our code, the keys should be ephemeral and thus short lived.
```bash
        Validity
            Not Before: Jan 18 20:34:14 2023 GMT
            Not After : Jan 18 20:44:14 2023 GMT
```
This section tells you information about the origin of the certificate. It should match our repo. More information about each OID can be found at [Sigstore](https://github.com/sigstore/fulcio/blob/main/docs/oid-info.md).
```bash
                URI:https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-github-generator/.github/workflows/generator_generic_slsa3.yml@refs/tags/v1.2.1
            1.3.6.1.4.1.57264.1.1:
                https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com
            1.3.6.1.4.1.57264.1.2:
                release
            1.3.6.1.4.1.57264.1.3:
                2efc48f2f0a83eb0eb279f18b612584cfa4963b2
            1.3.6.1.4.1.57264.1.4:
                Release
            1.3.6.1.4.1.57264.1.5:
                aerleon/aerleon
            1.3.6.1.4.1.57264.1.6:
                refs/tags/1.0.1
```

3. Inspect the SLSA file
The SLSA file contains information on what went into building the whl. This information includes things such as who initiated the build and hashes of every artifact.
```bash
cat provenance-sigstore-1.0.1.intoto.jsonl | jq -r '.payload' | base64 -d | jq
```

Since we use Sigstore for signing our code you can verify that our signing process is valid by looking at their transparency logs. You can find documentation on verifying binaries [here](https://docs.sigstore.dev/rekor/verify-release/).
