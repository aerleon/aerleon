        Denies all traffic to internal IPs except established tcp replies.
        Also denies access to certain public allocations.

        Ideal for some internal lab/testing types of subnets that are
        not well trusted, but allowing internal users to access.

        Apply to ingress interface (to filter traffic coming from lab)
