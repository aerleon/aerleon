"""Capture decorators fully capture the test output and compare it to a
reference file stored in the repo. The test is failed if output does not
match exactly.

While not the fastest to run, these tests are flexible, easy to implement,
and they describe a broad image of application behavior.

Test authors must carefully control any output non-determinism.

## Usage

To create a test that captures and compares stdout, annotate a test with
decorator @capture.stdout(). You may apply multple decorators to the same test.
This will capture standard output while the test is running and compare it
to a file in the test directory named "<test_filename>_<test_name>.ref".

Files written to disk by your test code can be captured using test annotation
@capture.file(pathlike) where pathlike refers to the target file. The
content that would have been written is compared with a file in the test
directory named "<test_filename>_<test_name>_<file_name>.ref".

Users may wish to place each test file in its own folder to avoid having an
excessive number of reference files in the same folder.
