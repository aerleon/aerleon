# Aerleon

Generate firewall configs for multiple platforms at once.

Aerleon is a fork of [Capirca](https://github.com/google/capirca) with the following enhancements:

- Support for new firewall platforms can be added through plugins. Plugins for
  common platforms are built-in. Users with experimental or non-public platforms
  can add support without forking this repo.
- YAML support for Policy, Network, and Services.
- Performance is generally faster.
- A well-documented Python API is provided which accepts native types.
- A cleaner test harness is provided for end-to-end tests.
- "Shade checking" is faster and more correct.

Aerleon requires Python 3.7 or higher.

```bash
pip install aerleon
