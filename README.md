# Aerleon

Generate firewall configs for multiple firewall platforms from a single platform-agnostic configuration language through a command line tool and Python API.

Aerleon is a fork of [Capirca](https://github.com/google/capirca) with the following enhancements:

- New platform generators can now be added as plugins. Users no longer need to fork the project to add support for new platforms. Common platform support is still built in.
- YAML is now supported for policy files, network definitions, and service definitions.
- A powerful new Generate API is added that accepts policies, network definitions, and service definitions as native Python data.
- Performance in address book generation for SRX and Palo Alto targets is greatly improved.
- A detailed regression test suite was added to the project.
- Unit and regression tests run automatically on all pull requests.
- New developer tools are integrated with the project: Poetry, PyProject, nox, Codecov, Sigstore.

## Install

Aerleon requires Python 3.7 or higher.

```bash
pip install aerleon
```

## Overview

Aerleon provides a command line tool and a Python API that will generate configs for multiple firewall platforms from a single platform-agnostic configuration language. It can generate configs for Cisco, Juniper, Palo Alto Networks and [many other firewall vendors](https://aerleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#core-supported-generators).

A [getting started guide](https://aerleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/) walking through the basics of using Aerleon is available on the docs website.
