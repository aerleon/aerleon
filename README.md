# Aerleon

Generate firewall configs for multiple platforms at once.

Aerleon is a fork of [Capirca](https://github.com/google/capirca) with the following enhancements:

- New platform generators can now be added as plugins. Users no longer need to fork the project to add support for new platforms. Common platform support is still built in.
- YAML is now supported for policy files, network definitions, and service definitions.
- A powerful new Generate API is added that accepts policies, network definitions, and service definitions as native Python data.
- Performance in address book generation for SRX and Palo Alto targets is greatly improved.
- A detailed regression test suite was added to the project.
- Unit and regression tests run automatically on all pull requests.
- New developer tools are integrated with the project: Poetry, PyProject, nox, Codecov, SigStore.

See the [1.0.0 Release Notes](https://github.com/aerleon/aerleon/releases/tag/1.0.0) for a complete list of changes.


## Install

Aerleon requires Python 3.7 or higher.

```bash
pip install aerleon
```

More detailed instructions can be found on the [Installation](https://aerleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install/) page.

### Usage

See [Getting Started](https://aerleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/).

## Policy Files

A policy file describes a security policy using _header_ and _term_ blocks.
Header blocks describe how to generate the output configuration of the security
policy. Term blocks define the access control rules within an ACL.

In .pol.yaml files, each ACL has exactly one header and one or more term
sections. In .pol file format, each ACL is defined by a top-level header block
followed by one or more top-level term blocks.

```yaml
acls:
  - header:
      comment:
        this is a sample policy for a zone based filter that generates multiple
        output formats. It checks logging options, tcp, udp and icmp type
        options.
      targets:
        paloalto: from-zone internal to-zone external
        srx: from-zone internal to-zone external
    terms:
      - name: test-tcp-log-both
        comment: Testing log-both for tcp.
        protocol: tcp
        logging: log-both
        action: accept
      - name: test-udp-log
        comment: Testing logging for udp.
        protocol: udp
        logging: true
        action: accept
```

See [Policy Files](https://aerleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/#policy-files) for full details.

## Address Book

Address book files define symbolic names for IP networks, hosts, and services.
Policy files may reference these names.

```yaml
terms:
  - name: deny-to-bad-destinations
    destination-address: RFC1918 BOGON RESERVED
    action: deny
```

```yaml
networks:
  RFC1918:
    values:
      - address: 10.0.0.0/8
        comment: "non-public"
      - address: 172.16.0.0/12
        comment: "non-public"
      - address: 192.168.0.0/16
        comment: "non-public"
  RESERVED:
    values:
      - address: 0.0.0.0/8
        comment: "reserved"
      - name: RFC1918
      - name: LOOPBACK
      # ...snipped...
  BOGON:
    values:
      - address: 0.0.0.0/8
      - address: 192.0.0.0/24
      - address: 192.0.2.0/24
      # ...snipped...
```

Users may wish to auto-generate address book files to keep them up to date. JSON
and CSV are accepted for this reason. See [Definition Files](https://aerleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/#definition-files) for full details.
